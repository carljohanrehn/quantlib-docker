# Docker files for create new images based on QuantLib image

Here you will find my collection of Docker files which use the Docker 
QuantLib Miniconda 3 image as base image.

Build images using build.sh (see comment on how to set your own tag). 

If you want to use your own tags, make sure to update the Docker files (replace my "name" with your own tag).

If you use other releases, update version numbers accordingly in Docker files.
