# Docker files for QuantLib development

Download and extract QuantLib releases from https://bintray.com/quantlib/releases.

Make sure the Docker files points to QuantLib-1.17 and QuantLib-SWIG-1.17 and build images using build.sh (see comment on how to set your own tag).

If you want to use your own tags, make sure to update the Docker files (replace my "name" with your own tag).

If you use other releases, update version numbers accordingly.
